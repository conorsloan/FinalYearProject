    {\LARGE\bf Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

Firstly, I would like to thank my project supervisor, Karim Djemame, for his unwavering support, guidance and patience, especially in times where circumstance made project progress difficult. This project would have been very difficult without his knowledge and experience. \\

Secondly, my thanks to Django Armstrong, who, despite having a very busy schedule, took the time to deploy OpenStack on the TestBed on behalf of my project, and was consistently responsive and helpful whenever there were technical issues concerning the deployment. \\

I would also like to thank David Duke, my assessor, whose feedback and guidance from my mid-project report and organised assessor meeting were invaluable in uncovering the real aims and identity of this project.
